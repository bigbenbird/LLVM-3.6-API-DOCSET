<dd>ttye 11/15/2013 Is the prefetch definition we want? Did not make the size a uint64_t as prefetching more than 4GiB seems excessive.  </dd>

<dd>Currently, accept only vector related types. Also we give up on all simple vector type to keep the existing behavior. Otherwise, we should push here all the check of the lowering of BUILD_VECTOR. By giving up, we lose the potential benefit of merging constant via global merge and the fact that the same constant is stored only once with this method (versus, as many function that uses the constant for the regular approach, even for float). Again, the simplest solution would be to promote every constant and rematerialize them when they are actually cheap to create. </dd>
